## PROBLEM STATEMENT
After engaging former and current sales agents of top loan-giving institutions in the country, I found out that 3 in every 5 of the agents are given generic loan repayment schedules to show prospective borrowers. Such a generic schedule looks like the one below:

**However, the problem is that these generic schedules are only successful 40% of the time, since it is only 12 in 30 borrowers who actually take up a credit product.** That said, 86% of the agents agree that showing a loan repayment schedule to a client increases their chances of taking a loan, and, in this case, a specific one as opposed to the generic one you see above. Such a specific schedule looks like the one below:

Investopedia.com says: _Understanding the loan amortization schedule on a loan you are considering ... can help you see the big picture. By comparing the amortization schedules on multiple options, you can decide: 1. what loan terms are right for your situation, 2. what the total cost of a loan will be and 3. whether or not a loan is right for you_.

When asked how well they agree with Investopedia.com, the agents said 100%. It is with those findings that I decide to start the development of SAApp (Sales Agents App).

**Does the project have an economical or commercial benefit, and does it solve a problem?**
Yes. The work done on this prototype can be used to create a more complex, highly-functional, and beautifully-looking app that loan-giving institutions can purchase. When they pay for the product and have their agents trained on how to use it effectively, they will increase their chances of selling their credit products. Based on the research done, using this product will give a loan-giving institution an 80% chance of getting a borrower, which is 8 in every 10 people that the agents talk to. Therefore, the problem of agents only being successful 40% will be addressed by the app's capabilities.


## PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
1. Adding, viewing, and deleting clients (loan-giving institutions).
2. Adding, viewing, and deleting agents (who work for loan-giving institutions).
3. Adding and viewing referrals added by agents. In the app, a referral is anyone who is interested in taking a loan. Once an agent send their details, the client should continue the conversation with the referral.
4. Generating loan repaymeny schedules for prospective borrowers. The loans can either be fixed interest or reducing balance interest.
