## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### PROBLEM
After engaging former and current sales agents of top loan-giving institutions in the country, I found out that 3 in every 5 of the agents are given generic loan repayment schedules to show prospective borrowers. Such a generic schedule looks like the one below:


However, the problem is that these generic schedules are only successful 40% of the time, since it is only 12 in 30 borrowers who actually take up a credit product. That said, 86% of the agents agree that showing a loan repayment schedule to a client increases their chances of taking a loan, and, in this case, a specific one as opposed to the generic one you see above. Such a specific schedule looks like the one below:

Investopedia.com says: _Understanding the loan amortization schedule on a loan you are considering ... can help you see the big picture. By comparing the amortization schedules on multiple options, you can decide: 1. what loan terms are right for your situation, 2. what the total cost of a loan will be and 3. whether or not a loan is right for you_.
When asked how well do they agree with Investopedia.com, the agents agreed 100%. It is with those findings that I decide to start the development of SAApp (Sales Agents App).
